# Development

## Arduino Sketch Basics

You can use the [Arduino IDE][] to develop a "sketch" that can be compiled and
uploaded to an Arduino-compatible microcontroller.

Sketches are stored in your "Documents" folder, under the 'Arduino' folder.

A sketch consists of a folder containing a file with the `ino` extension. Both
the folder and the file must have the same name.

* _DIY_MIDI_Controller_en
  * _DIY_MIDI_Controller_en.ino

Inside of your primary INO file you are
[required to have 2 functions declared][setup and loop].

* [setup()][] - Runs once, used to initialize variables, pin modes, initialize
  libraries, etc.
* [loop()][] - Runs the code infinitely. Intended to check for input on pins
  coming from components like potentiometers, buttons/switches, and sensors,
  and then respond with ouput on other pins.

## Arduino Tabs

The complexity of a large sketch file with over 1000 lines of code can be
daunting. In the Arduino IDE you can break up your sketch into separate files,
instead of storing all code in one file.

As outlined in the [Sketch Build Process][], your primary INO file that matches
the name of the sketch folder is concatenated with the code from the other INO
files in alphabetical order.

> All .ino and .pde files in the sketch folder (shown in the Arduino IDE as tabs
> with no extension) are concatenated together, starting with the file that
> matches the folder name followed by the others in alphabetical order

## VSCode

The Arduino IDE is designed to be less daunting for non-tech-related folks, so
it is limited in the options it provides.

If you want more abilities when developing, you can use [VSCode][] to develop
sketches.

## Arduino for VS-Code

Install the following recommended extensions for VSCode:

* [Arduino Community Edition][]
* C/C++
* C/C++ Extension Pack
* Serial Monitor

This Arduino extension relies on the [Arduino Command-Line Interface (CLI)][]
tool. It should prompt you to use a bundled version of the tool after you try to
run the first command with it. This may work for you, but on a Mac I had more
success by installing the Arduino-CLI and then configuring the path in the
VS Code settings for "Arduino: Path".

```bash
# Install Arduino CLI for Mac
$ brew install arduino-cli

# Get Path to Arduino-CLI to configure in VS Code Settings
$ which arduino-cli
/opt/homebrew/bin/arduino-cli
```

In VSCode, the functional Arduino commands are available from a menu in VSCode
that is accessed using F1, Ctrl + Shift + P, or Cmd + Shift + P (Mac).
From this menu type "Arduino" and the list of related commands will show.

Here are some commands for Arduino-CLI.

```bash
# view arduino-cli configuration
$ arduino-cli config dump

# initialize arduino-cli configuration
$ arduino-cli config init
Config file written to: /Users/jason/Library/Arduino15/arduino-cli.yaml

# list libraries installed
arduino-cli lib list
```

### VSCode Issues

The C/C++ Extension required by the Arduino extension will trigger warnings
and errors in the 'Output' panel in VSCode such as:

[#include errors detected. Please update your includePath]

[#include errors detected. Please update your includePath]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51227662/vscode-include-errors-detected-please-update-your-includepath

Once you successfully run the Verify for a sketch with no errors, a file named
c_cpp_properties.json should be generated by the Arduino extension which will
bring in a proper configuration for your environment.

## Wokwi

We are using the [Wokwi for VS Code][] extension, provided by the [Wokwi]
platform, to support a virtual prototype of the MIDI Controller.

Wokwi enables developers to simulate the behavior of common microcontrollers
such as the Arduino, ESP32, STM32, and Raspberry Pi Pico.

## C Programming Notes

### C PreProcessor

* [C Define PreProcessor]
* [C IfDef/EndIf]

```c
#define YEARS_OLD 6

function potentiometer() {
  // macros do not need to be unindented
  #ifdef YEARS_OLD
    Serial.print("Augustus Corgan is over %d years old.\n", YEARS_OLD);
  #endif
}
```
