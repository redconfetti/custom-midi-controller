## PlatformIO

Wokwi is a cloud-based platform, but you can also use it with the
[VSCode][Wokwi VS Code Extension]. The extension can be used with many
embedded development frameworks such as Zehpyr Project, PlatformIO, ESP-IDF,
Pi Pico SDK, NuttX, Rust, Arduino CLI, and MicroPython.

The [Arduino Simon Game][] example uses PlatformIO.

Arduino boards are based on the [AVR family of microcontrollers][] by Atmel.
Because of this, we specify the "platform" we use with the PlatformIO framework
as [Atmel AVR][Atmel AVR Platform].
