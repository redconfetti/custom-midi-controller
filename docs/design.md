## Fritzing Diagram

I originally created a diagram of a breadboard prototype in [Fritzing][].

I thought this would emulate the actual functionality with code, but that is
not the case. I instead moved to Wokwi as a solution for virtual prototyping.

I may still use this software to design a PCB, or instead use [KiCad][]
because of the [Kicad PCB Design course][] offered by Musiconerd.

## Wokwi

[Wokwi] provides the ability to create a virtual diagram of your device,
that actually emulates the AVR processor that is the basis of Arduino
microcontrollers using [AVR8js][].

See [MIDI Controller] for the current virtual prototype for this project.
